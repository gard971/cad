Files will be added here by the code automaticly when that is needed. The data folder will NOT be created and the app may crash witouth it so do NOT delete it
Please do not delete the users.json file. This will render the register and login functions usless. If you wish to delete all users change the users.json file to the following content:
{"table":[]}
this is the default value in the users.json and it will be the same as no users in the database
