you will need node.js installed on you computer for this app to work(https://nodejs.org/en/)
when you have installed node, CD into the app main directory and run the CMD command: npm install .
This will install all the required packages for this to work. Once that is done locate the startServer.bat file in the main directory and run it. This wil start the server.
after this you can find the app at the web adress: localhost:3000 . You will need to port forward for other computers to access the website. There are many tutorials on youtube on how to do that if you dont know how. You can change the port to anything you want in the index.js file in the "config" section.
Keep in mind this is a VERY alpha stage of the app and you migth encounter bugs and badly written code. This is my first project at this scale. 
If you do encounter any bugs i would really apreciate if you could let me know at my email: gardsoreng@gmail.com
